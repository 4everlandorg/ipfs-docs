# IPFS in Go

## Working with Go

Kubo (go-ipfs) is the oldest implementation of IPFS. It is a command-line application, but can also be used as a library in other Go programs.

For more about using Kubo, see any of the following reference documents:

- [Configuration reference](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md)
  - [Datastore configuration](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/datastores.md)
  - [Experimental features](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/experimental-features.md)
- [Installing command completion](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/command-completion.md)
- [Mounting IPFS with FUSE](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/fuse.md)
- [Installing plugins](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/plugins.md)

For more technical information about building, debugging or using the API, see:

- [Performance Debugging Guidelines](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/debug-guide.md)
- [IPFS API Implementation](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/implement-api-bindings.md)
- [Connecting with Websockets](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/transports.md)
- Building on [Windows](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/windows.md)
- [Additional guides](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/)

If you plan to use Kubo as a package in your own Go application, you can take any of three main approaches:

- Use [kubo](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo) to run Kubo IPFS directly in your own process.
- Use [kubo RPC client](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-http-client) to communicate with a Kubo IPFS daemon in a separate process via its HTTP RPC API (this is what Kubo does if a daemon is already running).
- Use other Go packages to communicate with the HTTP RPC API directly. See the [RPC API reference](/reference/kubo/rpc/).

## Go CoreAPI

[CoreAPI interfaces](https://godoc.org/github.com/ipfs/interface-go-ipfs-core) for go-ipfs. Package iface defines IPFS Core API, which is a set of interfaces used to interact with IPFS nodes.

## Go embedded client

[Package coreapi](https://godoc.org/github.com/ipfs/kubo/core/coreapi) provides direct access to the core commands in IPFS. If you are embedding IPFS directly in your Go program, this package is the public interface you should use to read and write files or otherwise control IPFS. **This package is experimental and subject to change.**

If you are running IPFS as a separate process, you should use `go-ipfs-api` to work with it via RPC. As we finalize the interfaces in this embedded client, `go-ipfs-api` will transparently adopt them so you can use the same code with either package.

## Go HTTP clients

[CoreAPI implementation using HTTP API](https://godoc.org/github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-http-client). **This package is experimental and subject to change.** For an old but stable Go HTTP client, use [CoreAPI interfaces](https://godoc.org/github.com/ipfs/interface-go-ipfs-core).

## Hands-on examples

There are use-case examples in the [`ipfs/kubo` GitHub repository](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs). They're all self-contained projects that let your spin up and test environments quickly. [Check them out â†’](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/tree/master/docs/examples).

A good starting place is the [Use kubo as a library to spawn a node and add a file](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/examples/go-ipfs-as-a-library/README.md).
