# Publish a file to IPFS with a pinning service

In this quickstart guide, you will learn about [pinning services](../concepts/persistence.md#pinning-in-context) and the lifecycle of content-addressed data in IPFS by pinning a file to the IPFS network using a pinning service called [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/). By the end of this guide, you should have a better understanding of how content addressing and CIDs work from a high level.

> **Note:** The web3.storage pinning service was chosen purely for demonstration purposes, and is one of many [pinning services](../concepts/persistence.md#pinning-in-context) you can choose from. While each pinning services has different SDKs and APIs, their fundamental role is the same - to store files and make them available to the IPFS network. In fact, one of the main benefits of IPFS is that files can be pinned to multiple pinning services, thereby reducing vendor lock-in.

## What is pinning?

Pinning a file to IPFS is how content is published to IPFS. Any given file represented by a CID can be pinned to multiple IPFS nodes to increase the redundancy and resilience of the file on the network. Pinning services are like hosting services that run an IPFS node for you and ensure that your files are available to the IPFS network.

It's worth noting that data pinned to the IPFS network is public by default and retrievable by anyone. Make sure to avoid publishing private data or take the necessary measures to adequately encrypt it before publishing.

## Prerequisites

- A free [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/) account.
- The [following image](/images/welcome-to-IPFS.jpg), downloaded and saved on your computer:

![image](/images/welcome-to-IPFS.jpg)

## Uploading and pinning a file

1. Sign into your account on web3.storage:

   ![web3.storage login window](./images/login-web3-storage.png)

1. After logging in, click on **Upload files** to open the upload tab:

   ![web3.storage upload button](./images/web3-upload-button.png)

   The Upload a file tab:

   ![web3.storage upload tab](./images/web3-upload-tab.png)

1. Upload and pin the file by either dragging the [image file](/images/welcome-to-IPFS.jpg) to the dashed rectangle, or clicking on the dashed rectangle to select the [image](/images/welcome-to-IPFS.jpg) file.

   Once the file has been successfully uploaded, the following displays:

   ![web3.storage file uploaded](./images/web3-file-uploaded.png)

   If you close the upload tab, you should also be able to see a shortened **Content Identifier (CID)** of the uploaded image, **`bafyb...d32wm3q4`**:

   ![file after upload](./images/web3-file-after-upload.png)

Congratulations, you have successfully **pinned** a file to IPFS! ðŸŽ‰

Let's unpack what just happened, by looking at CIDs, and how they fits into the lifecycle of data in IPFS

## What's a CID?

In IPFS, every file and directory is identified with a Content Identifier ([CID](../concepts/content-addressing.md)). The generated CID serves as the **permanent address** of the file and can be used by anyone to find it on the IPFS network.

For a file to be published to IPFS (like the image used in this guide), it has to be transformed into a content-addressable representation which generates a CID by hashing the guts of the file

The CID for your uploaded image is:

```plaintext
bafybeicn7i3soqdgr7dwnrwytgq4zxy7a5jpkizrvhm5mv6bgjd32wm3q4
```

You can now share the CID and anyone should be able to fetch it.

:::callout
Note that the transformation into a content-addressable representation can be a local operation that doesn't require any network connectivity. With web3.storage, this transformation happens on the client-side (in the browser.)

## The lifecycle of data in IPFS

To understand what happened when you pinned the file, it's helpful to understand the lifecycle of data in IPFS, which can be summarised as follows:

1. **Content-addressable representation**: The file is transformed into a content-addressable representation known as a [Merkle DAG](../concepts/merkle-dag.md). For this guide, the full details are not important. The basic idea is that this representation makes files and directories **content-addressable** via CIDs by chunking files into smaller blocks** and calculating their hashes.
2. **Pinning:** refers to the stage where the blocks of the CID are saved on an IPFS node (or multiple nodes), in this case web3.storage. Since saving is not enough for the CID to be retrieveable, pinning typically refers to two things:
   - **Advertising:** Making it discoverable to the IPFS network by advertising a record linking between the CID and the server's IP address to the network. This advertising stage is a continuous process that repeats. 
   - **Providing:** The content-addressable representation of the file is persisted on one of web3.storage's IPFS nodes (servers running an IPFS node) and made publicly available to the IPFS network.
3. **Fetching:** 
4. **Deleting**

## Fetching your published file

There are two main ways you can fetch the CID:
- IPFS node that implements the IPFS suite of protocols
- IPFS gateway: an IPFS node that provides an HTTP interface to the IPFS network and bridges between IPFS and HTTP.

### Using an IPFS Node



### Fetching the CID with an IPFS Gateway

## Conclusion

## Next steps

- If you prefer uploading with JavaScript or Go, check out the [Web3.storage docs](https://web3.storage/docs/how-tos/store/).
- Try out [Filebase](https://filebase.com/), a pinning service that offers an [AWS S3-compatible API for pinning](https://docs.filebase.com/getting-started/s3-api-getting-started-guide), so you can use any S3-compatible SDK, e.g. [aws-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk), and [many](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd) more.
